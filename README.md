CSS Reset
=========

__Disclaimer:__ I'm not owned or created a CSS reset, and I just created this repository for using CSS reset with an HTML test page.

The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on. The general reasoning behind this was [discussed in a May 2007 post](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/04/18/reset-reasoning/), if you're interested. Reset styles quite often appear in CSS frameworks, and the original "meyerweb reset" found its way into [Blueprint](https://code.google.com/archive/p/blueprintcss/), among others.
